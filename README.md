# 🌱 Karbon – Your Carbon Footprint Companion

Karbon (with a 'K') is a climate-conscious web application designed to help users track, plan, and optimize their daily carbon footprint through everyday appliance usage. Whether you're using an AC, microwave, or even a fridge – Karbon lets you calculate how much CO₂ you're consuming and how to make better choices.

## 💡 Why "Karbon"?

This project started from a failed idea at a hackathon I joined with a friend. Back then, we didn’t have enough coding experience and couldn’t bring it to life. But after a year of learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and logic building — this is our comeback. Karbon is more than just an app — it’s a promise to our planet and to ourselves.
